Problem Statement-

IPL matches produce a huge amount of live data that is often hard to track and analyze quickly. This makes it difficult for fans, coaches, and decision-makers to stay updated or draw insights. Our solution is we created a live IPL dashboard using Power BI to fix that. It gives users an easy way to explore and understand live match details with visuals and up-to-date stats.
